# 2022showcase

I haven't done much personal projects which include C++ too much in 2022.

Most of my work has been through educational and research pieces which includes teaching advance practice within coding and scripting principles.

All of my personal projects I have created in 2022 has been within Unreal, my use of C++ within unreal is down to creating tools to support making levels in editor or via BlueprintFunctionLibaries.

I have included in my showcase one of each:
1 / a tool that is used to create a path of points a player can grapple to and from. This is a simple lightweight tool that can be used within a procedural system or as a user defined tool.
2 / a blueprintFunctionLibary that was used within the pok√©mon open world jam I created for a "popular" youtube video.

I am currently to create more of these lightweight tools over the next year for Random Altered Memory.
